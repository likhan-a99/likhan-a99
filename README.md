I'm a Front End developer who is passionate about making an error-free website with 100% client satisfaction. I have a passion for learning and sharing my knowledge with others as public as possible. I love to solve real-world problems. I am strategic, goal-oriented, and always work with an end goal in mind. Over the past years, I created 10s websites for my clients. I pride myself on doing quality work and maintaining excellent communication. Most of the time I work with RAW web language but some technologies I enjoy working with include React.js, JavaScript as well as PHP.

## 🤹‍ Skills & Experiance:
✅ REACT <br>
✅ JS <br>
✅ PHP <br>
✅ HTML / CSS <br>
✅ Photoshop / Illustrator <br>
